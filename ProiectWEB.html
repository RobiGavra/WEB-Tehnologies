            <p style="margin-right:30px;"><b>The car guys</b>- leading sports and classic car exporter based in Japan is proud to announce the opening 
                of its new JDM auto import and sales facilities in Tacoma , USA. Now you can get all the benefits of working directly with an exporter in 
                Japan while enjoying the safety, security and ease of purchase that you have when working with a company here in the USA. 
                Until now it was never as easy to import your dream JDM to the USA as it is today!<br>
                With the opening of our own office in Tacoma, now we can import JDM cars at any major ports of the USA. The cars we import are 25 years
                old and fully exempt from EPA and FMVSS regulations, making it 100% federally legal to drive in the US highways. Now, only though us you 
                can buy your dream JDM car directly from Japanese dealers and auctions without ever having to worry about the passing through a mountain 
                of red tape paperwork. Our office provides all the import and registrations services, and after the purchase arranges the delivery 
                of your dream JDM car to your front door in the USA ready to be cruised around the highways of the US.

            <p style="margin-left:30px;"> <b>Subaru</b> is releasing yet another special high performance WRX STI that's only for its home, Japan. This time it's a
                variant of the WRX STI Type RA called the Type RA-R. Though it looks very similar to the version we get in the U.S., it has some key differences.
                Instead of the 310-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder in ours, the RA-R has a 324-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder. It also produces
                318 pound-feet of torque, a fair bit more than the 290 of ours.<br>
                The Type RA-R also boasts additional weight savings. The company says it's about 66 pounds lighter than the WRX STI S208, another
                special STI similar to our Type RA. That model was already lightened thanks to a carbon fiber roof among other additions. Interestingly, 
                the Type RA-R doesn't appear to have the Bilstein suspension of the S208 or the U.S. Type RA. It does still have Brembo brakes front and rear,
                though, with six-piston calipers up front and two-piston calipers in the back.
